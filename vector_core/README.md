# MnemoCore Vector Core (Experimental)

## Beta Notice

`vector_core` is an experimental area used for research tracks and prototypes.
It should not be treated as stable production infrastructure.

## Purpose

This directory contains exploratory work related to:
- retrieval/indexing approaches,
- migration tooling,
- Dream Stream related predictor experiments,
- benchmarking ideas and concept validation.

## Important Expectations

- APIs and file formats can change quickly.
- Performance notes in this folder are directional, not guaranteed.
- Some documents describe proposed future directions, not completed product behavior.

## Relationship to Main Runtime

The main runtime path for MnemoCore is under `src/`.
`vector_core/` should be read as supplementary research and prototyping material.

## Suggested Use

- Use this folder for isolated experiments.
- Validate findings before integrating with `src/core`.
- Keep reproducibility notes when running local trials.
