## Status

MnemoCore is published as a **beta / development preview**.

This means:
- No production readiness claim.
- No availability, performance, or compatibility guarantees.
- No commitment to stable APIs between beta releases.
- Experimental behavior is expected.

## No Promises / No Warranty

MnemoCore is provided "as is" under the MIT license.

- We do not guarantee correctness for any specific use case.

- We do not guarantee long-term support for current interfaces.

Always validate outputs independently before operational use.

## Recommended Usage During Beta

- Use in sandboxes, R&D, and controlled evaluation environments.
- Pin commit hashes for reproducibility.
- Treat data formats and endpoint contracts as potentially changing.
- Keep backups of data and configuration before upgrading.

## Production Adoption Guidance

Before production usage in your own environment, you should perform:
- Independent reliability testing.
- Security and privacy review.
- Capacity and failure-mode validation.
- Rollback planning and observability setup.
